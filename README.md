# RNN-Music-Generator for music in ABC notation

<p>
  This is a small project exploring the functionalities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We will use RNNs to learn patterns from raw sheet music written in ABC 
  notation, and then use the trained model to generate (i.e. predict) new pieces of music based on this learned information.

  This project runs in a Jupyter notebook that shows how to solve this task. In this notebook you will find more information about all the necessary steps with detailed 
  explanations for them. If you need further information about the code implementation, you will have to refer to the file "utils.py" in this repository.
